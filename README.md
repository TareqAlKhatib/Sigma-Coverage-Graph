# Sigma-Coverage-Graph
Generates an ATT&CK Navigator layer for Sigma rules. 

Usage:
```
python sigmaCoverage.py
```

The script assumes the Sigma rules are in the `./Rules` directory.

The attached sample output `sigma_coverage.json` contains the coverage of Sigma rules as of 2022-05-06. 
You can load the file in your instance of ATT&CK Navigator or the online version [here](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/).
